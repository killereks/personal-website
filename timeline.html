                        I was not happy with my old UI design, in fact it bothered me everytime I saw it. Today I decided to sit down and design a completely new look. I have these very simple white icons to represent different file types which I think look amazing. The folders have coloured icons so you can easily spot them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have also abandoned my old "Type full path here" approach and created breadcrumbs which can be seen on the second screenshot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have also discovered that when using Unity's buttons and the "Color Tint" option, you don't have to use the background image but can instead use an icon. I think it looks much better when you highlight the text/icon instead of a background suddenly appearing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I fixed few bugs and added more bugs to fix later ;)

                        Today I have decided to mess around with a file explorer and since I have created a nice file structure with some methods such as <code class="language-clike">FileSystem.GetFilesInDirectory(string path);</code> and <code class="language-clike">FileSystem.GetFoldersInDirectory(string path);</code> it was very easy to add working folders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Funnily I struggled more with adding history than displaying the folder structure and making sure u can click on them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I still need to figure out how to make it look nice, if you are interested in helping me with this project feel free to contact me on the <a href="contact.html">contact page.</a>

                        Today I have started re-writing how my files are created. I've realised that simply instantiating files in various places can be problematic when I want more complex behaviour. For example zip files would then require file instances which is way more work than it should be. I have decided to create a file system structure similar to windows one to try and imitate a real operating system more closely. Now I can simply feed the file data into the tree and ask another function to generate it where ever I want it.

                        However I noticed that it's extremely complicated to use in the default Unity inspector, so I have wrote my own (which can be seen in the picture).
